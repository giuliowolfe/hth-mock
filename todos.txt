Done

1. wire up index page - renders a list of labs
2. wire up a lab page - render text for confirmation
3. wire up a toolbox page - render text for confirmation
    - add in a serach bar and button (not functional yet)
5. lab schema in models dir; integration of mongo + mongoose
6. createlab page to make a basic project
7. individual labs on index page redirect to lab page (url shows mongo _id
but not rendering data into the page yet) 
8. added the '&format=json' to end of route to allow me to see json as needed
9. deloyed it to heroku: https://hthmock.herokuapp.com/
  in its current state:
  a. the homepage lists the current "labs" (fake labs).
  b. you can click on the lab and it goes to its own lab page. You can add '&formet=json' at the end of the url to see the raw json showing the keys and value pair. (15. Nice start! I tried to add '&formet=json' at the end of the url, but nothing changed)
  c. to create a new lab you have to actually go to: https://hthmock.herokuapp.com/createlab , and input the information and click submit which sends to the mongoDB. This is not protected yet (see below todos). (16. I also tried the form, looks neat as basic wire!)


To-Dos:

1. Toolbox search: hook up to mongoDB (new schema--Tool.js? Or just new key:value pair in current Lab.js schema ie 'toolbox' and 'labs' to seperate them when searching.
2. Toolbox: search functionality of projects from toolbox
3. Toolbox: when you click on a tool, redirect to specific tool page

5. Add in front-end theme
6. Pare down theme
7. Add in partials

8. add login/register 


GC:
I want them to see those 2 options, where the Toolbox allow immediate access
to the content, while the Labs link opens a sign up/ sign in page as you need
to be registered to create a lab.
